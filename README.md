# Atlassian-Scripts
This is a repository of my scripts for Atlassian. I thought it might be best to host them somewhere easy to fork as I might not be able to maintain them forever.

Jira scripts:
Reindex.pl was tested with versions 5.2.4 and 6.0.7. Should work with versions older than that, possible all the way back to 3.5.

Reindex.sh has been tested with version 6.1+ and should work with no extra packages on most linux distributions. Uses Bash and curl.

Confluence scripts:
Space_export.pl - use xmlrpc to trigger space export and download resulting .zip file.
